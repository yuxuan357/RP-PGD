# RP-PGD & RP-PGD++
A Region-and-Prototype-Based Adversarial Attack to Enhance the Robustness of Segmentation Models

Adversarial attack and defense have been extensively explored in classification tasks, but their study in semantic segmentation remains limited. Moreover, current attacks fail to act as strong underlying attacks for adversarial training (AT), making it difficult to achieve segmentation robustness against strong attacks. In this paper, we present RP-PGD, a novel Region-and-Prototype based Projected Gradient Descent attack tailored to fool segmentation models. In particular, we propose a region-based attack, which leverages a spatial-temporal way to separate the pixels into three disjoint regions, and highlights the attack on the crucial True Region and Boundary Region. Moreover, we introduce a prototype-based attack to disrupt the feature space, further enhancing the attack capability. To boost the robustness of segmentation models, we inject adversaries generated by RP-PGD into the clean data and perform AT. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets showcase that RP-PGD generates adversaries with faster convergence and stronger attack effectiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin. Consequently, RP-PGD serves as a strong underlying attack for segmentation models to perform AT, assisting them in defending against a variety of strong attacks without incurring additional computational costs during inference.

This is the official project of our work AAAI work RP-PGD ([paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33122)) and its enhanced version RP-PGD++ (under review).

## Project Setup
To install the environment of the project, please install Python 3 and PyTorch with Anaconda:
```shell
conda create --name rppgd python=3.8
conda activate rppgd
```

Then clone this repo and install the corresonding requirements:
```shell
git clone --recursive git@github.com:yuxuan357/RP-PGD.git
cd RP-PGD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Hardware Requirement
We strongly recommend utilizing 4 to 8 GPUs, each equipped with >= 24GB memory (such as NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs), for optimal performance.

## Training
The dataset Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, and ADE20k can be downloaded from the website as follows:

1) Pascal VOC: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/ (with SBD augmentation);
2) Cityscapes: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/;
3) ADE20k: https://ade20k.csail.mit.edu/

Change the data root of these datasets in the config files.

For pre-trained backbone, please refer to the readme in ``initmodel" to download the weight of the initial checkpoint pretrained on ImageNet.
